AC-FOVE for CRALC
==========================================================

This project intends to implement the AC-FOVE algorithm using the Credal ALC description language.

The steps I am willing to take to accomplish this are:

- Implement a very basic version of the VE algorithm

- Implement the C-FOVE algorithm using CRALC

- Implement the AC_FOVE algorithm using CRALC

It is in a very raw stage right now. Let's hope I can finish this.
